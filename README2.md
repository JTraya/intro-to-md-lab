# How to make the Perfect PB&J Sandwich

Peanut butter; a creamy and rich spread derived from peanuts. Grape Jelly; a sweet and succulent gel made from grapes. Combined together between two soft slices of bread create a delcious combination of flavor renowned as the Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich or PB&J for short.

## Basic Ingredients - THE OUTLINE

+ **Bread**: any two slices of bread preference depends on the individual 
+ **Peanut Butter**: choice varies as well creamy, chunky, nutty, etc.
+ **Jelly**: in my opinion grape jelly is superior but any choice will suffice

## Order or creating the sandwich - THE CREATION

First off, you'll grab your pieces of bread and lay them on a flat, clean surface. Next you'll grab the jelly and the peanut butter. Designate one piece of bread to hold your jelly and the other to hold your peanut butter. Spread generously and evenly amongst the bread. Once each piece of bread has their designated spread on it and it has been thoroughly applied it is time to place the two pieces of bread together. As simple as it sounds take this step with a bit of *finesse*. Align correctly and behold the sight of the Perfect PB&J Sandwich.

### End result should follow this hierarchy somewhat:
> Bread
>> Peanut Butter
>>> Jelly
>>>> Bread
